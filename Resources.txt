These are my resources

Check list for things to consider/ add
- acceleration/ braking
- onboard view or maybe top down to make it more simple f1
- racing line w/ brake lines
- time recorder
- high score screen
- walls 
- track
- grass or gravel/ off the track (will slow down cars)
- track limits violations
- Silverstone (do another track if you have time)
- Look at racing line in comparison to the track (not needed but recommended)
